# Frontend Web Development Competition Webpage

This repository contains the code for a webpage developed for the Frontend Web Development Coding Competition, where I achieved 1st place out of 33 contestants. The competition mandated the use of pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no frameworks allowed. The entire project had to be completed within a 3-hour time limit at Xdezo Technologies. <br>
