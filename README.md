# Frontend Web Development Competition Webpage

This repository contains the code for a webpage developed for the Frontend Web Development Coding Competition, where I achieved 1st place out of 33 contestants. The competition mandated the use of pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no frameworks allowed.

## Design
The design for this project was provided as a Figma design. We were required to translate this design into a functional webpage. Here’s the Figma design alongside the final webpage implementation:
- **Figma Design**: 
  <img src="assets/images/Design.jpg">
- **Webpage Implementation**: 


## Project Overview

The project showcases my ability to design and implement a responsive and interactive webpage using only the core web technologies:
- **HTML**: For structuring the content and layout.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and dynamic features.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The webpage adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes interactive features implemented using JavaScript.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensures consistent performance across various browsers.
- **Custom Font**: Uses a custom font, Bingkow, included via `@font-face`:

  ```css
  @font-face {
      font-family: bingkow;
      src: url("../font/Bingkow-BF66e3ef79797b9.ttf");
  }
